                    <p>Our model for The Intentional Learning Theory (TILT) is one that is very helpful and an easy to understand. It was developed based on the conclusion that learning is a result of some specific behaviours that can be intentionally performed. Although it is true that there are behaviours that lead directly to learning, learning can occur without the learner having to first intend it to happen. We describe that situation as accidental learning—which is how animals learn. Accidental learning is the opposite concept of intentional learning.</p>
                    <p>As humans, however, we are capable of learning both accidentally and intentionally. We could learn without intending to and we can also learn by deliberately choosing to do so. On the one hand, we are not in charge of whether we learn and on the other hand, we are in charge.</p>
                    <p>It really is a problem if we leave our learning to chance by continuing to learn accidentally like animals. That approach would lead to manifest learning difficulty and slow learning recorded at a very large scale. The learning trajectory around the world today takes the shape of a pyramid that keeps enlarging at the bottom while the top gets narrower—thereby indicating that few people (considered to be gifted) top the learning chart while more people (considered to be ‘not so gifted’) struggle for space in the ever enlarging bottom. The fact that school enrolment and literacy levels have increased remarkably in every continent over the last century, has not changed the shape of the learning pyramid.</p>

                <div class="col-md-8">
                    <p>The reason is simple; people are still learning accidentally—they are not in charge of their learning—they don’t know exactly how to move from ignorance to knowledge without fail each and every time they have to learn anything. The stark reality that stares at us right now is that most of our species can but do not learn fast because they do not know exactly how. One doesn’t stand the chance to do something faster until they know how to do it.</p>
                    <p>Consequently, we do not want learners, of all ages and levels of education, to continue to leave their learning to chance when they can be deliberate about how fast and effectively they learn, and whether they learn at all. We want them to be aware of the specific behaviours that lead to effective learning—so that they can go on to keep learning and build their capacity to global competency levels.</p>
                    <p>The specific behaviours that lead directly from ignorance to knowledge and mastery of any subject matter one wishes or has to learn about are known as learning skills. There are fifteen learning skills that guarantee effective learning on any and every subject matter.</p>
                    <p>These fifteen learning skills have been grouped into five. There are skills that help us assimilate or acquire information; process and understand information; recall information, master and use or manipulate with information, and a last group that helps the learner regulate their engagement with all the skills of the other groups. There exists a sixth group that tries to determine the learner’s level of readiness to receive learning instructions. A learner’s level of readiness refers to the extent to which they are mentally, emotionally, socially and physically adjusted to receive learning instructions.</p>
                    <p>With these areas captured in the design, this site provides a technology that helps each learner to ascertain the exact cause of their poor academic performance and or intellectual prowess by identifying what skills that would have led to a better outcome are not being intentionally and regularly used, if they are used at all. Once the deficiencies are identified, the system generates expert advice that would help the learner to improve in their academic performance within record time; provided that they carry out the recommendations diligently.</p>

            </div>

            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-md-12">
                    <p>The learner who takes the test on this site gets the result that the system generates emailed to them once they tab on “get result”, and complete the process for the comprehensive result.</p>
                    <p>So this technology gets learners started on becoming aware of how to intentionally learn when they carry out the recommendations contained in the result (comprehensive or summarised) that the system sends to the email they provided when they signed up.</p>
                    <p>The logic here is simple. For example, if one possesses the culinary skills (learning skills) needed to prepare fried chicken (excellent performance), we should always have fried chicken (excellent performance which is the outcome of effective learning) each time they use the skills (intentional learning) given the right ingredients (learning materials or learning instructions).</p>
                    <p>The science with which this model was developed is simple and straight forward. For example, amongst other skills that ensure assimilation of information, it takes listening skill for one to acquire learning instructions. If they use their listening skill well they will acquire the instruction as they are required to. However, processing and understanding the acquired instruction is an aspect of learning to be achieved with the help of some other learning skill(s). What this means is that it takes a combination of simple learning skills that are used intentionally for one to learn, master and use knowledge competently in any given situation—in academics, business, vocation and career.</p>

                    <p>The detailed result obtained from this platform can serve as an invaluable indication of learner’s behaviour which a guidance and counselor and or school learning consultant can use to begin a counseling session in a way that focuses on providing solutions to already identified issues.

                    <p>One of the most significant benefits of the tilt.ng testing platform is in the way it enables school administrators or proprietors or principals and directors of schools to observe the learning behaviours of learners within their school walls and monitor progresses over time by leveraging educational technology that is progressive and helps them generate data that would be useful for the formulation of policies that can confer them with a level of scientific precision in solving learning related challenges being experienced by learners in the learning institutions they lead. This is a much needed strategic help that would help educational executives provide the leadership that their team and business need to produce learners of outstanding performance.</p>
